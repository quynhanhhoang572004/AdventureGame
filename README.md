**Introduction:**
* *Idea: We made a decision to create a top-down 2D- platformer game inspire by youtuber name ryoSnow where our character is moving around in  different levels  to find objects that need to kill some monster, to increase its blood, to light up around when night comes and also use that object to move to the next level or winning the game.*

**The 2D Adventure Game "Frost King's Tale":**
> 1. The Flow:
   - About the Frost King's Tale game, there are two levels and two different maps; Players enjoy the game in two different environments.
     a) The Hand Manipulation:
     
     + To play this game, we always use four main push buttons: W to go up, A to turn left, S to move down, and D to turn right and LEFT MOUSE to attack the monster. The other push button is ENTER, which the user uses when they want to talk with the npc that we created to talk with the character or select any object that the character collects inside its pocket. Another one is ESC which is often used to open the setting and turn off the menu, full screen of the game when we turn it on.
       
      b) The items:

     + There are several items that are created for users to obtain and make it simpler to slay the bear and the monster on map two.They are Diamond_shield, red_potion, axe, diamond_sword, chirstmas_boot and lantern,....
       
     c) The quests:

      + After clicking "New game" to begin the game or "quit" to end it. The "New game" will cause the application to take you to the first map, which represents the first level of the "Frost King's Tale game". The user should control our main character to move and look around to find things for map level two. There will be GNPC guiding the character during the journey. However, in order to collect things, our character should have to run away and fight from the monster called polar bear to gather things and cash for map two as well as buy some objects to level up its skill. Once the character successfully kills a  polar_bear he will receive a coin which can be used to buy things in map two .
     
     + So, after collecting items in map one, the player can control the player to find the way to where they can trade and sell objects to level up the character's skill to kill the boss in map 2 and then the character  must discover a way to get to map two. In this second map, the game will immediately transport the character to map two, which will look something like this. However, one thing to remember is that the dungeon map is always in the dark filter, therefore the lantern is always necessary in map two and should be collected in map one. Furthermore, the user should control the character who will fight these monsters, whose attacks are much stronger than the polar bear in map one. Our character cannot win without changing his weapon, which is why the user must collect a lot of items in map one .

     + Finally, the frost kingâ€™s need to kill all the monsters (especially Lord of The Orcs) which exist in the map to win. Once you beat all the monsters, the game is finally done. Congratulations on your victory !
       
> 2. The Design:
  - The game's scene: 
    + Manages the visual representation of the player character .
    + Handles sprite animations for different directions and attack actions .
    + Implements visual effects such as invincibility .
     
  - The Characters and Objects:
    + Was made up and designed meticulously by our team, using Piskel .
    + The characters have their own storylines and dialogues to interact with player.
    + The game flow was arranged reasonably to attract the player .

  - The sound and music:
    + Variable, set the tones of the play during the adventure .
